# Hello, World!

Hello and welcome to my new website. I have a bunch of exciting things planned for the future and needed a place to post about them so, I will be posting summaries of my project work as well as moving some of my archived portfolio from my [NuVu Page](https://cambridge.nuvustudio.com/louie-adamian). The website will stay bare-bones for now but I will upload more content in the coming months.


Enjoy, 
Louis
