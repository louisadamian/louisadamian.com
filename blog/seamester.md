On May 12th I returned from 103 days at sea with Sea|Mester where I sailed from Falmouth Harbour, 
Antigua to Nadi, Fiji via St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Panama, and The Galápagos.

My trip Started in January 2021 in Antigua aboard Sailing Yacht Argo, We stayed in Antigua for 2 
weeks learning the ropes, starting classes and some amazing scuba divingthere. We then sailed to
Saint Vincent and The Grenadines, where we got to experience more fantastic scuba diving, 
beautiful hikes and gorgeous sunsets. From Saint Vincent and The Grenadines we sailed for 7 days to 
Colon, Panama. We stayed at a marina north of Colon for 4 days before going through the Panama Canal.

Getting through the canal took 2 days, 1 day to go through each set of 3 locks on each side of the 
canal. For going through the canal the boat was spit up into 4 teams, one for each line on the bow 
and stern of the port and starboard sides, each line had to be taken up as the water raised on the 
way up and eased on the way down and you were fighting the currents from the water being pumped in 
the locks moving a 150 ton boat.

Once we were in the pacific in Panama City we started prepairing for another 8 day passage to San 
Cristobal in the Galapagos. At this point we started talking about the end of the trip, originally
we were supposed to end in fiji
