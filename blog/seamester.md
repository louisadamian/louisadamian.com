# Sea|Mester

![S/Y Argo](./img/argo_stvincent.jpg =60%)

On May 12th I returned from 103 days at sea with Sea|Mester where I sailed from Falmouth Harbour, Antigua to Nadi, Fiji
via St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Panama, and The Galápagos.

My trip Started in January 2021 in Antigua aboard 
Sailing Yacht Argo, We stayed in Antigua for 2 weeks learning the ropes, starting classes and some amazing scuba diving
there. We then sailed to Saint Vincent and The Grenadines, where we got to experience more fantastic scuba diving, 
beautiful hikes and gorgeous sunsets. From Saint Vincent and The Grenadines we sailed for 7 days to Colon, Panama. We 
stayed at a marina north of Colon for 4 days before going through the Panama Canal.
