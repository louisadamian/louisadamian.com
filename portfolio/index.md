## Portfolio
I am a student, amateur marine biologist, scuba diver, and an avid computer engineer. I spent 2020 working for Cherish Health, a healthcare technology startup based in Cambridge, MA.  I was part of a small team creating a device for in-home health monitoring looking for emergencies such as falls and tracking for long-term anomalies in activities of daily living. This spring I participated in a study abroad program called Sea|mester where I sailed from English Harbour, Antigua to Nadi, Fiji. I am currently looking for job opportunities in the greater Boston area. My focus has previously been on embedded baremetal C++, and I am interested in computer security and Linux operating systems.
