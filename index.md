## My name is Louis Adamian

I am a student, amateur marine biologist, scuba diver, and avid computer engineer. In the spring of 2021, I participated in a study abroad program called Sea|mester Where I sailed from English Harbour, Antigua to Nadi, Fiji. I am currently looking for job opportunities in the greater Boston area. My focus has previously been on embedded baremetal C++.
