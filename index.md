## My name is Louis Adamian

I am a student, amateur marine biologist, scuba diver, and an avid computer engineer. I spent 2020 working for Cherish Health a healthcare technology startup based in Cambridge, MA that is creating a device for in-home health monitoring looking emergencies such as falls and looking for long term anomalies in actives of daily living. This spring I participated in a study abroad program called Sea|mester Where I sailed from English Harbour, Antigua to Nadi, Fiji. I am currently looking for job opportunities in the greater Boston area. My focus has previously been on embedded baremetal C++, but I interested in computer security and Linux operating systems.
