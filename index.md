## My name is Louis Adamian

I am a student, amateur marine biologist, scuba diver, and an avid computer engineer. I am currently looking for job oportunites in the greater Boston area. My focus has previously been on embedded baremetal C++, but I interested in computer security and linux opperating systems.
