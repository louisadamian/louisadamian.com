## My name is Louis Adamian

I am a student, amateur marine biologist, scuba diver, and avid computer engineer. I am currently working on Printed Bircuit Board prototype manufacturing at Electroninks. When I am not working I am either Scuba diving or Sailing. In the spring of 2021, I participated in a study abroad program called Sea|mester Where I sailed from English Harbour, Antigua to Nadi, Fiji on a 112 foot long schooner.
