## My name is Louie Adamian

I am a computer programmer, maker, and student. I am currently an intern at Cherish Health working on electronics and 
software prototyping for an in home ambient health monitoring device. I have a background in making I went to NuVu 
Studio for high school. At NuVu Students learn by working on projects. Each project lasts 2 weeks and in that time you 
form ideas, create prototypes, select the best version and create another highever fidelity prototype using what was 
learned from the previous ones to inform the decisions in the new design. I am currently putting all what I learned at 
NuVu into practice at Cherish Health. When I am not a student or working I love to SCUBA dive and marine biology. I 
learned to SCUBA dive at SeaTrek BVI and found my love of marine biology. My first year I got my NAUI scuba diver, 
advanced diver, Underwater Naturalist, and Digital Image Diver. The second year I got my Nitrox Diver, and Scientific 
Driver. I also did a project on the health of Acropora Palmata and Acropora cervicornis after hurricane Maria.
